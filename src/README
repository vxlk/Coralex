Project description: Shooting, explosions, bullet pool

The easiest part of this project:
Restart

Problems that I had in completing this project:
Iterators
Pool
RECORDING THE SOUND.  sound would not record in my vm.  It did not play on school computers.  It compiled, that's all I know.  I had to use software outside of my vm to record my vm.  It was annoying.

A few sentences describing my proposed project:
A player controls two players and takes a base in the middle.  The sniper shoots the tank is your front line.  I wrote the music for the project :).
